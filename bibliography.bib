abstract = {A census of the biomass on Earth is key for understanding the structure and dynamics of the biosphere. However, a global, quantitative view of how the biomass of different taxa compare with one another is still lacking. Here, we assemble the overall biomass composition of the biosphere, establishing a census of the ≈550 gigatons of carbon (Gt C) of biomass distributed among all of the kingdoms of life. We find that the kingdoms of life concentrate at different locations on the planet; plants (≈450 Gt C, the dominant kingdom) are primarily terrestrial, whereas animals (≈2 Gt C) are mainly marine, and bacteria (≈70 Gt C) and archaea (≈7 Gt C) are predominantly located in deep subsurface environments. We show that terrestrial biomass is about two orders of magnitude higher than marine biomass and estimate a total of ≈6 Gt C of marine biota, doubling the previous estimated quantity. Our analysis reveals that the global marine biomass pyramid contains more consumers than producers, thus increasing the scope of previous observations on inverse food pyramids. Finally, we highlight that the mass of humans is an order of magnitude higher than that of all wild mammals combined and report the historical impact of humanity on the global biomass of prominent taxa, including mammals, fish, and plants.}}

abstract="Monozygotic (MZ) twins are an ideal model for scientific research since many of the confounding factors associated with most human studies, such as DNA sequence and environment, can be eliminated. Although MZ twins are genetically identical, they typically display some level of phenotypic discordance. With the emergence of the study of epigenetics, scientists have hypothesized that differences in epigenetic marks may account for some phenotypic discordance in MZ twins. Comparative analysis of the epigenomes of MZ twins discordant for disease, including cancer, obesity, and diabetes, has led to the identification of epigenetic modifications, including changes in DNA methylation, histone marks, and differences in microRNA expression, that may contribute to the disease phenotype. Following identification of these changes, researchers are working to elucidate both the cause and the potential mechanism by which these modifications may lead to disease. Understanding how epigenetic modifications drive changes in phenotype using MZ twin studies may serve as a powerful tool in identifying new experimental opportunities in health and disease.",

abstract = {Aging is a complex process influenced by a combination of genetic, epigenetic, and environmental factors. Genetic components donate almost 30% of the aging phenotypic variance, while epigenetic modifications that serve as environment X gene mediator are considered to be the major contributors. Epigenetic modifications (i.e., DNA methylation and histone modifications) can affect the gene expression and genomic stability and thus underlie age-associated diseases. Another mechanism found to be involved (may serve as a biomarker) with aging process is telomere attrition. Cellular telomeres shorten with age until a critical length, which results in a vital genomic material loss, thus triggering the cell to enter replicative senescence. This attrition is compensated by telomerase activity that maintains telomere length and support cell proliferation. Telomere length and telomerase activity are also regulated by epigenetic modifications that shape the telomere structure and influence its maintenance. Furthermore, telomeres can regulate epigenetic factors affecting gene expression of nearby genes. In sum, there is a clear cross talk between telomeres maintenance and epigenetic modifications that accompanied aging and age-related pathologies.}

abstract = {Environmental stressors, such as childhood maltreatment, have been recognized to contribute to the development of depression. Growing evidence suggests that epigenetic changes are a key mechanism by which stressors interact with the genome leading to stable changes in DNA structure, gene expression, and behaviour. The current review aimed to evaluate the relationship between stress-associated epigenetic changes and depression. Human studies were identified via systematic searching of PubMed/Medline from inception to February 2018. Seventeen articles were identified. Stress-associated epigenetic changes in the following genes were correlated with depression: NRC31, SLCA4, BDNF, FKBP5, SKA2, OXTR, LINGO3, POU3F1 and ITGB1. Epigenetic changes in glucocorticoid signaling (e.g., NR3C1, FKBP5), serotonergic signaling (e.g. SLC6A4), and neurotrophin (e.g., BDNF) genes appear to be the most promising therapeutic targets for future research. However, continued research is warranted due to inconsistent findings regarding the directionality of epigenetic modification. Future studies should also aim to control for the use of psychotropic agents due to their widespread use in depressed populations and established effects on DNA methylation.}

abstract = {Extracts of the very large eggs of the African clawed frog, Xenopus laevis, have proven a valuable model system for the study of cell division. Cheng and Ferrell found that after homogenization, such cytoplasm can reorganize back into cell-like structures and undergo multiple rounds of division (see the Perspective by Mitchison and Field). This reorganization apparently occurs without the usual factors that are known to lead to such structural changes during cell division, such as F-actin, myosin II, various individual kinesins, aurora kinase A, or DNA. What is required is energy from adenosine triphosphate, microtubule polymerization, cytoplasmic dynein activity, and a specific kinase-involved cell cycle progression. Nongenetic information in the cytoplasm is apparently sufficient for basic spatial organization of the cell. Science, this issue p. 631; see also p. 569 Homogenized frog egg extracts can rearrange themselves into cell-like structures. Every daughter cell inherits two things from its mother: genetic information and a spatially organized complement of macromolecular complexes and organelles. The extent to which de novo self-organization, as opposed to inheritance of an already organized state, can suffice to yield functional cells is uncertain. We used Xenopus laevis egg extracts to show that homogenized interphase egg cytoplasm self-organizes over the course of ~30 minutes into compartments 300 to 400 micrometers in length that resemble cells. Formation of these cell-like compartments required adenosine triphosphate and microtubule polymerization but did not require added demembranated sperm nuclei with their accompanying centrosomes or actin polymerization. In cycling extracts with added sperm, the compartments underwent multiple cycles of division and reorganization, with mother compartments giving rise to two daughters at the end of each mitotic cycle. These results indicate that the cytoplasm can generate much of the spatial organization and cell cycle function of the early embryo.}}

abstract = {Until now, the first fossil evidence of land plants was from the Devonian era 420 million years ago. However, molecular phylogenetic evidence has suggested an earlier origin in the Cambrian. Strother et al. describe an assemblage of fossil spores from Ordivician deposits in Australia dating to approximately 480 million years ago (see the Perspective by Gensel). These spores are of intermediate morphology between confirmed land plant spores and earlier forms of uncertain relationship. This finding may help to resolve discrepancies between molecular and fossil data for the timing of land plant origins. —AMS Spore-like microfossils help to resolve a discontinuity between molecular and fossil records of the origins of land plants. Molecular time trees indicating that embryophytes originated around 500 million years ago (Ma) during the Cambrian are at odds with the record of fossil plants, which first appear in the mid-Silurian almost 80 million years later. This time gap has been attributed to a missing fossil plant record, but that attribution belies the case for fossil spores. Here, we describe a Tremadocian (Early Ordovician, about 480 Ma) assemblage with elements of both Cambrian and younger embryophyte spores that provides a new level of evolutionary continuity between embryophytes and their algal ancestors. This finding suggests that the molecular phylogenetic signal retains a latent evolutionary history of the acquisition of the embryophytic developmental genome, a history that perhaps began during Ediacaran-Cambrian time but was not completed until the mid-Silurian (about 430 Ma).}}

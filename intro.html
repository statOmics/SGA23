<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Setting the scene</h1>
<p>Bioinformatics is an interdisciplinary field of science that develops
methods and software tools for understanding biological data, especially
when the data sets are large and complex. However, before we focus on
methods to build knowledge on biological processes, it is important to
ask ourselves the question what life is.</p>
<p>When thinking about science it is crucial, as <span
class="citation">Bohm (1980)</span> nicely formulates, to acknowledge
that scientific theories are not “true knowledge” corresponding to “the
reality as is”, but rather ever-changing insights that are giving shape
and form to how we view and experience the world.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-is-life" class="section level1" number="2">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">2</span> What is life?</h1>
We will start this introduction with Bohm’s example of a sunflower seed
from which an entire plant is growing.
<div>
<div style="position:relative; padding-top: 56.25%">
<iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_owPRdbaMdY?si=Hpee5spcKofhWsEo" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen style="position:absolute;top:0;left:0;width:100%;height:100%;">

<p><em>Timelapse of a growing sunflower (Source: <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_owPRdbaMdY"
class="uri">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_owPRdbaMdY</a>)</em></p>
<p>Remarkably, each plant cell contains all information from the seed,
i.e. all its DNA as well as its cellular structure. However, as <span
class="citation">Bohm (1980)</span> points out the seed contains little
to nothing from the actual biomass of the plant that it has developed.
The seed merely contains the information that is required to transform
its environment to grow the plant from solar energy and the chaos of
simple molecules CO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>, nitrogen,
phosphorous, etc. The plant will eventually produce new seeds, which
will spread its information further throughout the environment and will
transform it over and over again to grow plants. It thus becomes obvious
that we do not need to make the distinction between “inanimated” and
“animated” matter. Indeed, if we would stick to this old Cartesian way
of thinking we are confronted with confusing questions like when would a
so-called “inanimated” carbon atom become animated? As soon as it enters
the leaf stomata or when it is assimilated into an organic compound?
Does the carbon atom becomes inanimated again when it is released from
the plant as it burns the sugars it has assimilated into CO<span
class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> during the night?</p>
<p>Indeed, we can consider that the environment is augmented with the
information of the seed, which somehow seems to direct its environment
to grow a corresponding plant. So life itself can be regarded as
belonging to a totality including plant and the environment. So <span
class="citation">Bohm (1980)</span> concludes that “we do not need to
fragment the whole into life and inanimated matter, nor do we have to
try to reduce life completely to nothing but an outcome of the
latter”.</p>
<p>The remaining of this chapter builds on the work of five
scientists:</p>
<ul>
<li>Erwin Schrödinger who explicitly defined life as structuring
“order-from-disorder”,</li>
<li>Ilia Prigogine who developed the theory for this and coined the term
“Dissipative Structures”,</li>
<li>Christian de Duve one of the founding fathers of biochemistry,
and</li>
<li>Humberto Maturana and Francisco Varela with their concept of
autopoiesis and emerging properties.</li>

<div id="schrödinger-and-prigogine-a-thermodynamic-view-of-life"
class="section level2" number="2.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.1</span> Schrödinger and
Prigogine: a Thermodynamic View of Life</h2>
<p>In his seminal lecture series: “What Is Life? The Physical Aspect of
the Living Cell” <span class="citation">Schrödinger (1944)</span>
defined life as</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>an open system that can generate order from chaos by exploiting
external energy sources,</p></li>
<li><p>with the capacity to transmit its own specific blueprint from
generation to generation.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Note, that in his seminal lecture series <span
class="citation">Schrödinger (1944)</span> also laid out key functions
of the molecule that was involved in this specific blueprint and this
while DNA was not even discovered.</p>
<p>At first, the property that life can generate order or structure
seems to contradict the second law of thermodynamics that states that: a
system is always gearing towards maximal entropy.</p>
<p>Entropy can be loosely defined as a physical quantity for the level
of how energy is spread out. It is thus the tendency of a system to
evolve from a concentrated energy state to an energy state that is more
spread out. This can be easily understood from a simple example known to
each of us: if you put a hot pot in a large room, the pot will cool down
and the temperature in the room will slightly rise until the pot and the
room have the same temperature. As a result the concentrated heat energy
from the pot is nicely spread out over the entire room.</p>
<p>Schrödinger understood that life was not violating this second law.
Indeed, by being an <em>open</em> system, it can interact with the
environment, and by eating and breathing there has to be a way of
“concentrating order” or maintaining a higher more concentrated energy
state.</p>
<p>Prigogine was the first one who provided the theoretical framework
for a type of chemistry that is key for life <span
class="citation">(Prigogine and Stengers 1984)</span>. He realized that
the chemistry of life is totally different from most chemical systems
that were studied up to then. Indeed, the chemistry and processes of
life are highly non-linear with many feedback loops and are operated far
from equilibrium by continuously pushing matter and energy through
it.</p>
<p>We intuitively know the latter: our body is typically at a higher
energy state than the corresponding material in a non-living state. We
can simply acknowledge that as we are hotter than the room, and a crude
way to estimate how long we are death is by measuring the temperature of
a corpse. To maintain our higher energy state, to concentrate chemicals
in our cells, and, to build complex molecules, cells and tissues from
it, we have to keep on eating and breathing.</p>

<div id="dissipative-structures" class="section level3" number="2.1.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.1</span> Dissipative
structures</h3>
<p>Prigogine discovered that complex self-organising systems can
spontaneously arise if they are open and can exchange lots of energy and
matter with their surroundings. Key for it is a chaos of matter and a
flow of energy through the system.</p>
<p>Convection currents are for instance an example of a simple physical
process generating massive structures. They can be observed when simply
heating a shallow layer of fluid or gas from below, which establishes a
temperature gradient that lets the fluids rest state to become unstable.
Indeed, the warmer fluid at the bottom is lighter and starts to float to
the top where it cools down again, whereas the colder fluid at the top
is more heavy and sinks to the bottom, where it is heated. Large
ensembles of molecules therefore start to exhibit coherent patterns of
motion (see Figure @ref(fig:convectionCells)).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/convection_cells.png" alt="Convection cells in a gravitational field. A fluid layer is heated from the bottom. The warmer fluid at the bottom becomes lighter and floats to the top where it cools down again, whereas the more heavy colder liquid sinks to the bottom where it is heated.

Con-struct)
</p>
</div>
<p>The convection motion leads to a spontaneous complex spatial
organisation, almost a dance, of billions of molecules moving coherently
and forming hexagonal convection cells. Such convection cells can be
observed in a small dish of a fluid in a lab, up to the level of the
earth’s atmosphere and the solar photosphere (see movie below).</p>

<p><em>Movie of the solar photosphere observed with the Swedish 1-m
Solar Telescope (SST) on La Palma, Spain. The movie shows solar
granulation which is a result of convective motions of bubbles of hot
gas that rise from the solar interior. When these bubbles reach the
surface, the gas cools and flows down again in the darker lanes between
the bright cells. In these so-called intergranular lanes, we can also
see small bright points and more extended bright elongated structures.
These are regions with strong magnetic fields. (Source: Wikipedia, user
Luc.rouppe, link: <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Granulation_Quiet_Sun_SST_25May2017.webm"
class="uri">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Granulation_Quiet_Sun_SST_25May2017.webm</a>)</em></p>
<p>Prigogine showed that spontaneous self-organisation also occurs in
chemical systems that are operated far from equilibrium by continuously
pushing matter and energy through it. These self-organising processes
are largely unpredictable and spontaneously arise in our universe. <span
class="citation">Prigogine and Stengers (1984)</span> further argue that
such chemical and physical processes are the basis of the complex
self-organisation that we observe in living systems.</p>
<p>In chemical systems the influx of energy allows the generation of
structure while producing lots of entropy by dissipation. Dissipation
means that energy has been converted from one energy form to another and
that it can no longer be converted back in its original form. So
dissipation is irreversible, which adds the arrow of time to life.
Indeed conversion of energy to heat inherently takes place in all
underlying chemical reactions and these cannot be reversed without the
addition of new energy. Hence, a large part of the concentrated energy
that enters cells through sunlight or chemical energy in food, is spread
out in a less concentrated energy form: heat.</p>
<p>The structure that spontaneously emerges in living organisms is thus
not violating the second law because of the rise in entropy by the
dissipation of heat. Prigogine therefore coined the novel term
dissipative structures for such systems.</p>
</div>
<div id="attractors" class="section level3" number="2.1.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.2</span> Attractors</h3>
<p>Dissipative structures typically have multiple attractors,
i.e. states, regimes, forms, shapes or structures to which they
spontaneously evolve. The specific attractor to which the system is
organising itself highly depends on the initial environmental
conditions. Note, that dissipative structures are also characterized by
feedback loops. These feedback loops allow the system to remain at its
current attractor upon changes in the environment, e.g. a kind of
homeostasis. However, some environmental stimuli are amplified by the
feedback loops and can switch the dissipative structure towards another
attractor and thus induce a regime switch.</p>
<p>Prigogine argued that chemistry in cells, cells itself, tissues,
organs, organisms, populations of organisms, ecosystems and our globe
can be seen as dissipative structures <span class="citation">(Prigogine
and Stengers 1984)</span>. The fruiting body of slime molds are a
compelling example of a living system that often changes from attractor,
see Figure @ref(fig:Dictyostelium). Dictyostelium slime molds, spend
most of their lives as separate single-celled amoeba. But, upon stress
one of the amoebas releases a chemical signal cAMP. Others detect this
signal, and respond in two ways: the amoeba moves towards the signal and
secretes more cAMP effectively boosting the signal. So the signal gets
amplified by a feedback loop which eventually triggers the system to
switch from their current attractor - a state of free living amoebas -
towards a novel attractor - their fruiting body - that will release
spores and will spread the slime molds towards novel environments (see
e.g. youtube movie <a href="https://youtu.be/bkVhLJLG7ug"
class="uri">https://youtu.be/bkVhLJLG7ug</a>).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.1.3</span> Dissipative
zones</h3>
<p>Our whole globe can be seen as a large dissipative structure located
in our solar system, which is a dissipative zone.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>There is an energy source, the sun that is radiating concentrated
energy in photons.</p></li>
<li><p>Life forms are organising structure from the chaos of molecules
on Earth by dissipating energy from the solar photons, light and UV, to
heat through their organic pigments, e.g. chlorophyll.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals, bacteria and fungi are secondary dissipative structures
that are feeding on the concentrated chemical energy in the form of
sugar, starch, proteins and fats that are produced by plants and
cyanobacteria. They again dissipate energy in the form of heat through
respiration.</p></li>
<li><p>The heat produced by life is dissipated to water and air and this
induces tertiary dissipative processes like the water cycle, wind and
sea currents etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Eventually heat is radiated to space, which acts as an energy
sink.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Because the temperature of Earth remains roughly stable, more or less
a similar amount of energy is radiated to space under the form of heat
as what comes in under the form of photons from the sun. As the energy
content of heat is lower and more disperse it has a higher entropy than
that of the incoming sunlight. Because almost no mass is exchanged
between Earth and space, mass has to be recycled and life is inherently
cyclic.</p>

<p>Multicellular organisms are composed of multiple cells. The cells are
organised in tissues, e.g. spongy tissue in our bones or epithelium
cells of our stomach; organs, e.g. bones or our stomach; organ systems,
e.g. skeleton or digestive system; upto the organism. Figure

<p>“Life is One” because all living organisms use the same “energy
coin”, the ATP-ADP system, to store and reuse energy.
Adinosine-triphosphate (ATP) consists of a ribose sugar with 3 phosphate
groups and a base adinine. Splitting a phosphate group from
adinosine-triphosphate (ATP) results in adinosine-diphosphate (ADP), a
free phosphate group and energy. The other way around, energy can be
stored as chemical energy by binding a phosphate group to ADP (see
Figure @ref(fig:atp-adp)).</p>
<p>Note, that ATP is also used to build RNA, an important molecule
involved in storing, passing and expressing our genetic information.
Indeed, ATP is incorporated in RNA upon splitting two phosphate groups.
The resulting AMP (adinosine monophosphate) is one of the building
blocks of RNA. See Section @ref(sectionNucleicAcids) for more details on
RNA. So there is a close link between energy and genetic
information!</p>

<p>Lipids, fats and oils, are used for storage. However, an important
class of lipids, the phospholipids, make up membranes of cells and
unicellular compartments called organelles see Figure @ref(fig:lipids).
Indeed phospholipids have a polar head that likes to be in water and a
long apolar tail that does not mix with water. Therefore bilayers of
phospholipid molecules are spontaneously formed in aqueous
solutions.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>Membranes provide the basis for concentrating specific molecules in
(compartments of) living cells. This enable cells to build up a
disequilibrium of chemical molecules that can perform work as a
concentration gradient spontaneously dissipates toward its equilibrium
value. So phospholipids are key for creating the boundary conditions
necessary for cellular organization.</p>

Acids</h5>
<p>Amino acids by themselves are simple molecules (Figure
@ref(fig:aminoAcids)). Although hundreds of amino acids exist in nature,
life is using only 20 of them and it is combining them in long
molecules, polymers, which are referred to as proteins. Proteins are
hetero-polymers, consisting of the 20 amino acids that are arranged in
long sequences that differ from protein to protein. So unlike starch,
that only consists of glucose molecules that are all identical, proteins
are capable of carrying information.</p>
<p>(ref:aminoAcidsCap) Amino acids are simple molecules. They can be
combined in long molecules, polymers, also known as proteins. Their long
chain of amino acids spontaneously folds into a complex 3D structure

<p>The crux of proteins is that their long chain of amino acids
spontaneously folds into a complex 3D structure, which is determined by
the properties and the specific sequence of its amino acids. From their
complex and specific 3D structure their biological function emerges.</p>
<p>Indeed, many proteins work as a “lock” in which specific
(bio)molecules fit as a “key”. This enables proteins to bring molecules
close together and to promote chemical reactions without being consumed.
This process is also referred to as catalysis and proteins that perform
catalysis are called enzymes, see Figure @ref(fig:enzyme).</p>

<h5><span class="header-section-number">2.2.1.3.4</span> Nucleic

<p>Nucleic acids are build of nucleotides. Each nucleotide is composed
of one of four nitrogen-containing nucleobases, which carry the
information</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>cytosine [C],</li>

<p>These nucleotides are the building blocks that are combined in long
polymers: RNA and DNA. DNA and RNA are hetero-polymers and the
nucleotides conceptually can be combined in any order. So they can
contain information. Indeed, they are key to store and use the genetic
information we inherit from our parents.</p>
<p>DNA typically occurs as a double strand, where C and G, and, A and T
hybridize to each other using respectively three and two hydrogen
bridges to form the iconic double stranded helix structure, see Figure
@ref(fig:DNA).</p>
<p>There is a general consensus that life probably began by using RNA as
information carrier. DNA, however, is much more stable and lasts longer
in water than RNA. Therefore, DNA probably emerged later and is now used
to store the genetic information in most organisms.</p>

catalysis in more detail, and we also give an intriguing example of how
proteins play a role in the self-organisation of a cell.</p>
<div id="energy" class="section level4" number="2.2.2.1">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.1</span> Energy</h4>

</div>
<div id="catalysis" class="section level4" number="2.2.2.2">
<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.2.2</span> Catalysis</h4>
<p>“Life is Chemistry” because most chemical reactions are catalyzed,
i.e. initiated, promoted and made faster by proteins. The proteins
facilitate the reaction without being used. The reactions would never
take place if we would only mix the molecules at the concentrations that
are typically occurring in a cell.</p>
<p>A catalyst is a chemical substance that helps a reaction to take
place without being consumed. Proteins that are catalysts are also
referred to as enzymes.</p>
<p>Enzymes are proteins that</p>
<ul>
<li>initiate the reaction</li>
<li>speed up the reaction and</li>
<li>make sure that the outcome is always the same.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loosely speaking they are</p>
<ul>
<li>“fishing” certain molecules from the complex mixture in a cell,</li>
<li>which consists of thousands of chemical compounds generally at low
concentrations,</li>
<li>through binding sites they can facilitate that these molecules
(substrates) are getting close so that they can react and form a new
compound.</li>
</ul>
<p>These binding sites emerged from to the unique 3D structure of the
protein. In Figure @ref(fig:enzyme) a schematic overview is given of the
enzyme action of a protein.</p>
<p>In most cases enzymes work together in pathways, which consist of
multiple chemical reactions for which (part of the) molecules produced
in the previous reaction are used by another enzyme to facilitate the
next reaction.</p>
<p>The Krebs cycle is a well known example. This pathway is the main
source of energy for a cell through metabolising carbohydrates, lipids
and/or proteins. The Krebs cycle is a cyclic pathway of multiple
chemical reactions each catalyzed by another enzyme (see Figure
@ref(fig:krebsCycle) or the you tube movie <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yk14dOOvwMk"

inherit from our parents, is stored in our DNA. DNA is a hetero-polymer
or a long chain of 4 different building blocks, nucleotides. So the
genetic information is stored in an alphabet of 4 letters. This is
adenine (A), cytosine (C), guanine (G) and thymine (T) for DNA.</p>
<p>It makes no physical or chemical difference what the identity of the
next nucleotide is in the DNA chain. So our DNA can be seen as a coding
system to store and pass genetic information from one generation to the
next. Life is therefore also information and not only chemistry. It is
absolutely mind blowing how variation in the sequence of this “four
letter code” can lead to such a wealth of distinct characteristics and
functions that can be observed between different specimens of the same
species, and, even more so between different life forms.</p>
<p>In the reminder of this section we will focus on the flow of
information in a cell in more detail.</p>

<h4><span class="header-section-number">2.2.3.1</span> The central
paradigm” of molecular biology</h4>
<p>The “central paradigm” of molecular biology states that the sequence
of nucleotides in DNA are first <em>transcribed</em> into RNA and then
<em>translated</em> into proteins, see Figure
@ref(fig:centralParadigm).</p>
<p>Note, that some RNA molecules are also end products. Indeed RNA can
also have a catalytic function, i.e. initiate and promote chemical
reactions without being consumed.</p>
<p>A <em>gene</em> is the unit of genetic material, a DNA sequence that
is encoding for the synthesis of a gene product, either a protein or a
functional RNA.</p>

<p>Figure @ref(fig:transcriptionTranslation) shows the process of
transcription of a gene from DNA to RNA and the translation of RNA to
proteins.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>The transcription of DNA to RNA is initiated by opening the DNA
double strand. Then a complementary RNA strand is synthesized by
exploiting that A hybridizes to U (or T) and G to C through hydrogen
bounds.</p></li>
<li><p>Once that the complementary RNA strand is made, it is further
processed in the nucleus into messenger RNA (mRNA). The mRNA travels
from the cell nucleus to the cell cytosol (cell liquid) where it is
translated into proteins, and, where the majority of the reactions take
place.</p></li>
<li><p>There mRNA is translated into proteins by ribosomes. In the
ribosomes the mRNA is bound to transfer RNA (tRNA). tRNA can bind to the
mRNA molecule if it has 3 consecutive nucleotides that are complementary
to the triplet of the 3 consecutive nucleotides on the mRNA template
that is lying in the ribosome.</p></li>
<li><p>The transfer RNA transports one specific amino-acid that is then
incorporated in the protein that is being formed, which is the growing
amino acid chain in Figure @ref(fig:transcriptionTranslation). The
sequence of 3 consecutive nucleotides of DNA of a gene is therefore also
called a <em>codon</em> because it encodes for a specific amino
acid.</p></li>
<li><p>Upon incorporation, the ribosome shifts to the next triplet of
the mRNA and the next transfer RNA is bound to it, and so on until a
stop codon is reached and the protein is finished.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(ref:transcriptionTranslationCaption) In the cell nucleus the DNA
strand opens up and is transcribed into an RNA molecule. Upon
processing, the messenger RNA (mRNA) travels from the nucleus to the
cytosol where it is translated into proteins. The mRNA is the template
that fits into a ribosome that has the function to bind transfer RNA
molecules to the mRNA template. It does that by hybridising to a tRNA,
which has a triplet of three nucleotides that are complementary to those
of the mRNA template. The tRNAs have a amino acid on their tail, which
is incorporated into a long chain of amino acids, the protein that is
produced. If the amino acid is incorporated, the ribosome moves to the
next triplet and the process happens all over with a new tRNA (Source:

</div>
<p>There are in total 64=4<span class="math inline">\(^3\)</span> codons
encoding for each of the 20 amino acids, and, for a start and a stop
codon to initiate and stop the protein translation, respectively. Hence,
there is a redundancy in the code, see @ref(fig:codonTable).</p>

</div>
<p>We can learn an important message from the codon table:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>There is no chemical necessity that explicitly connects the three
nucleotides “CGG” to the amino acid arginine rather than to
glutamine.</p></li>
<li><p>Nucleotides themselves do not seem to a have chemical connection
to the amino acids they encode</p></li>
<li><p>Therefore we call it a code or information rather than just
“genetic chemistry”</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The code apparently evolved so that many mutations give rise to</p>
<ul>
<li>synonymous codons (same amino acid) or</li>
<li>to incorporate amino acids that are similar</li>
</ul>
<p>so that protein function is conserved.</p>
<p></br></p>
<p>DNA is thus the carrier of genetic information. However, RNA plays a
more central role:</p>
<ul>
<li>Messenger RNA brings the genetic information from the cell nucleus
to the cell cytosol where they are translated into proteins and where
most of the chemical reactions take place.</li>
<li>Ribozymes, i.e. catalytic RNA molecules, initiate and speed up
particular reactions</li>
<li>Transfer RNA plays an crucial role in the translation of
proteins</li>
<li>An RNA primer, i.e. a small RNA molecule, is essential to copy
DNA</li>
<li>RNA also acts as carrier of genetic information, e.g. corona

<div id="maturanaVarela" class="section level2" number="2.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">2.3</span> Maturana and Varela:
a Systems View of Life</h2>
<p><span class="citation">Capra and Luisi (2014)</span> write in their
book “The Systems View of Life”, that the “term
<strong>autopoeisis</strong> was coined by Varela and Maturana in the
1970s. <em>Auto</em>, of course, means <em>self</em> and refers to the
autonomy of self-organising systems; and <em>poiesis</em> (which shares
the same Greek root as the word poetry) means <em>making</em>. So,
<em>autopoiesis</em> means self-making”.</p>
<p>They continue stating that “the main characteristic of life is
self-maintenance due to internal networking of a chemical system that
continuously reproduces itself within the boundary of its own
making”.</p>
<p>Indeed, a living cell is the smallest autopoietic unit. The cell
consists of a complex internal network of chemical reactions and this
within the boundary of its outer membrane. It can organize itself,
maintain itself, can make copies of itself and this with the enzymatic
machinery that is present in the cell itself.</p>
<p><strong>Networks of cells</strong> are then combined in larger
autopoietic units, e.g. </p>
<ul>
<li>our gut microbiome that consists of a network of billions of
unicellular bacteria and yeasts from which unique metabolic functions
emerge that are essential for digesting our food, or,</li>
<li>our tissues, networks of our own cells from which novel functions
emerge, e.g. our thinking that emerges from the complex network of
neurons in our brain.</li>
</ul>
<p>An organism or a biological system can therefore not be broken down
or reduced to its parts to provide a complete understanding of it. A
complete understanding is only possible when it is viewed as a whole.
Indeed, new functions emerge at a higher level from the network that has
been formed between its lower-level parts. Varela refers to these
properties with the term <em>emergent properties</em>.</p>
<div id="emergent-properties" class="section level3" number="2.3.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.1</span> Emergent
properties</h3>
<p>Emergent properties can be found at each level. At the chemical
level, where the protein hemoglobin for instance has the unique property
that it can transport oxygen. This property emerges from its unique 3D
structure (see Figure @ref(fig:hemoglobin)). We could never have derived
its biological function at the protein-level by breaking it down to its
constituting amino acids and only studying the individual properties of
each of these amino acids (see section @ref(sectionAminoAcids) for more
details on amino acids).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/hemoglobin.jpeg" alt="Structure of hemoglobin that consists of 4 subunits, each having a heme group with an iron molecule that can bind oxygen. This function emerges from its unique 3D structure (Source: Wikipedia)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">
Structure of hemoglobin that consists of 4 subunits, each having a heme
group with an iron molecule that can bind oxygen. This function emerges
from its unique 3D structure (Source: Wikipedia)
</p>
</div>
<p>So hemoglobins’ property to transport oxygen naturally emerges at the
protein level upon combining many simple amino acid molecules in the
appropriate sequence. Indeed, this specific long chain of amino acid
spontaneously folds into a unique 3D structure that gives the hemoglobin
protein its unique function.</p>
<div style="page-break-after: always;"></div>
<p>Lichens are another compelling example of emergent properties (Figure
@ref(fig:lichen)). Lichens are true colonists. They were among the first
organisms that colonized the earth surface. Indeed, when glaciers pull
back lichens appear on the bare hostile rocks and in the course of
thousands of years they can convert these rocks into soil, an
environment that is fertile for other species. However, their unique and
important properties for life on earth could never have been expected
when only studying a lichen’s components.</p>

<p>Although lichens macroscopically look like one being, they are
effectively two beings: a green algae with the precious gift of
photosynthesis that turns sunlight and air into sugars, and, a fungus
that provides shelter and is gifted with the art to mine the rocks for
minerals, but which cannot make sugars. They are joined in a symbiosis
that is so close that their union becomes an entirely new organism. When
biologists tried to unravel this unique algal-fungal marriage, they
started to grow them in the lab in ideal conditions for both algae and
fungus. However, under these conditions they both happily lived next to
each other. So the unique properties of lichens could not be delineated
from studying both species apart. Only when the scientists exposed them
to ecofactors that became so harsh, they teamed up in reciprocity and
gained their unique transformative power of turning rocks into fertile
environments <span class="citation">(Kimmerer 2013)</span>.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.2</span> Life as an emergent
property</h3>
<p><span class="citation">Capra and Luisi (2014)</span> convincingly
argue that the same holds at any level and for life itself. Indeed the
autopoietic property of a cell originates by properly combining all its
molecules in the large networks of chemical reactions from which its
structure and organisation, self maintenance, and self replication
emerge. We cannot localize life. Life is simply a global property that
emerges from the collective interactions of all kind of molecules in a
cell, of the collection of cells in a tissue, of the collection of
tissues in a organ system, of the collection of organ systems for an
organism, of the collection of organisms in a population etc. At each
level we have a network of lower level components from which new
properties naturally emerge.</p>
<p>So life itself is an emergent property, it is not present in the
parts it originates from, and only emerges when its parts are assembled
together correctly.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.3</span> Life as a gestalt
of autopoetic unit, cognition and environment</h3>
<p>For Maturana and Varela cognition is also inseparable from
autopoiesis <span class="citation">(Capra and Luisi 2014)</span>. Each
living organism is an open system that interacts with its environment
through its sensory arsenal. It senses its environment, it feeds on its
environment, releases products in it, it changes its environment, and,
actualizes itself to its environment. The fact that an organism is
changing its environment is often overlooked. However, life has
dramatically transformed Earth. Indeed, think of photosynthesis for
instance that radically changed Earth by the release of the highly
reactive molecule oxygen.</p>
<p>An organism at any time in its development is a record of its
previous interactions with its environment and that determines its
future interactions. Hence, cognition is a natural product of its
evolution.</p>
<p>Varela sees life as a gestalt of three domains <span

<li>Environment,</li>
<li>Cognition and</li>

class="section level3" number="2.3.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">2.3.4</span> Our social system
as an emergent property</h3>
<p>The insights of Maturana and Varela have the compelling implication
that we no longer need the duality of matter and mind when trying to
understand human life. Life naturally arises as an emerging property of
the large networks of matter or molecules at the level of each
individual cell, the basic autopoietic unit, and then new properties
emerge at a higher level when combining autopoietic units into tissues,
organs, organ systems, organisms, populations, etc.</p>
<p>As such, we can also view our cognitive awareness as an emerging
property of the network of our neurons in our brain in response to the
history of our interactions with our environment. Similar to other
species, the unique novel functions and processes that do arise when
human entities are forming networks are astounding.</p>
<p>Indeed, at the next level, the network of people, our rich
psycho-socio-emotional realm emerges. As human beings, our lives do not
only take place in the physical domain, but also in the symbolic social
domain, which is also very important for our development <span
class="citation">(Capra and Luisi 2014)</span>.</p>
<p>Similar to the biochemical system of a cell, the social system is an
open system with social feedback loops. Indeed, each social system needs
to sustain itself in a stable but dynamic way, by letting new members,
materials and ideas to enter the system, which will in turn be
transformed by the internal rules or organisation of the system <span
class="citation">(Capra and Luisi 2014)</span>, leading to a kind of
“social homeostasis”. Sometimes, these novel ideas can be so powerful
that they transform the social system by itself, i.e. switching it
towards a novel attractor. At the individual level, however, the
transformation implied by the social system sometimes are a bliss, but
they also can cause trauma. The observation that the “bio-logic” or
pattern of organisation of a simple cell is similar to that of an entire
social structure has large implications.</p>
<p>Indeed, as <span class="citation">Kimmerer (2013)</span> points out
so convincingly in her book Braiding Sweetgrass, these insights also
invites us to learn from all forms of life that are surrounding us. The
lichen example can teach us on our relationships and society. Indeed, in
the lab environment when resources were plentiful both the fungus and
green algae did not interact, only when the environment became harsh for
both of them, they join forces and take their unique lichen form where
there are intimately intertwined. A similar disruption of our social
function can be seen in our modern western society that is flooded by
resources, which cultivates individualism and loneliness.</p>
<p>So this shared bio-logic from cells up to our symbolic realm,
suggests a fundamental unity of life <span class="citation">(Capra and
Luisi 2014)</span> and has large implications for our
weltanschauung.</p>

<p>The most common theory is that our cosmos started with the Big Bang.
A very energy-rich state.</p>
<p>By expanding the universe quickly cooled down enough for energy to be

more heavy helium nuclei.</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.1</span> Genesis of
Stars</h3>
<p>Under the influence of the gravitational force, matter then started
to cluster in nebula, gaseous clouds essentially consisting of hydrogen
(H) and helium (He).</p>
<p>Due to concentration difference in these first nebula, these clouds
further contracted and eventually imploded (See Figure
@ref(fig:genesisStar)).</p>

</p>
</div>
<p>Extreme heating in the nebula that imploded by gravity gave rise to a
condition in which all matter was in the form of a super hot plasma. In
such a plasma nuclear fusion spontaneously takes place. In this process
light atoms are combined into more heavy atoms and much energy is
released.</p>
<p>First all hydrogen atoms are converted into helium (see Figure
@ref(fig:nuclearFusion)). The mass of the resulting Helium nuclei is
slightly lower than that of the original helium nuclei and the mass
difference has been converted again into energy.</p>

<p class="caption">

<p>Therefore, the star cools down, implodes and subsequently explodes

nuclear fusion further occurs towards more heavy elements up to iron

<p>A supernova gives rise to new nebula and these will eventually lead

<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.1.2</span> Carbohydrates in

<p>Upon nuclear fusion in the stars many different elements are formed.
For life, hydrogen, carbon, oxygen, sulfur, phosphorous and nitrogen
atoms, among others, are key to compose organic matter.</p>
<p>In interstellar space, carbon reacts spontaneously with other
elements to form poly-aromatic carbohydrates (PAHs). This is for
instance visible in a photograph of the Cat’s paw nebula (Figure

<p>PAHs were already be generated shortly after the Big Bang. Once they
are produced, they are further transformed in interstellar space upon
reaction with hydrogen and oxygen
<!-- via hydrogenation (reaction with hydrogen), oxygenation (reaction with oxygen) -->
among others to form precursor molecules (“forerunners”) for amino acids

<p>In a remote corner of our milky way, which is an average galaxy, an
average planet was formed, which we know as our planet Earth. After the
Earth cooled down liquid water was formed. The unique features of liquid
water are essential for life as we know it. Indeed, once liquid water
was available, life emerged in less than 300 million years, which is
very short time interval on the geological timescale.</p>
<!-- Water is a peculiar molecule and it has the unique feature to form hydrogen bounds between the hydrogen and oxygen atoms of different molecules (see Figure \@ref(fig:water)).

<p>First, a chemical evolutionary process gave rise to organic molecules
with increasing complexity. It is a general consensus that RNA molecules
emerged first from free nucleotides. RNA molecules are known to be
catalytic and are carriers of genetic information. They can also
replicate themselves under anoxic conditions (in the absence of oxygen)
and in the presence of iron, conditions that occurred at young planet
Earth (e.g. <span class="citation">Hsiao et al. (2013)</span>). These
RNA molecules evolved either alone, the RNA-world hypothesis, or already
in conjunction with proteins.</p>
<p>Next, it is assumed that prebiotic molecules, which could
self-replicate, were encapsulated by phospholipids, which spontaneously
form membrane like structures. This resulted in a protocell with a
membrane (see Figure @ref(fig:originOfLife)). In these protocells a
further chemical evolution was possible, separated from the environment,
which ultimately led to a self-replicating and self-organizing cell that
was built from the four essential type of bio-molecules of life: lipids,
carbohydrates, proteins and nucleic acids.</p>
<p>Further biological evolution of these first living cells eventually
gave rise to our last universal common ancestor (LUCA). LUCA must have
had at least 355 genes, which all living organisms have in common. LUCA
was anaerobic, living without oxygen, and maintained its hereditary
material using DNA, the genetic code, and produced proteins from RNA
templates in ribosomes. LUCA retrieved its energy from oceanic volcanic
activity in deep sea vents, i.e. the intensely hot plumes caused by
seawater interacting with magma erupting through the ocean floor. And
eventually LUCA evolved into all species that currently live on
Earth.</p>

<p>At its origin about 4.5 Billion Years Ago (BYA) the Earth was black,
a hot basalt rock and dust in a cold vacuum. As the Earth cooled down
she became Grey Earth (4.3 BYA) as she was mainly covered by granite and
rocks. Another 500 million years later she was covered with liquid
water: Blue Earth (3.8 BYA).</p>
<p>In only 300 million years she radically changed into Red Earth (3.5
BYA) due to life. Indeed, cyanobacteria emerged that can do
photosynthesis and produce oxygen, a very reactive molecule. This led
all free iron in the ocean to precipitate as iron oxide or rust (red).
There was an explosion of the number of minerals, they went from
approximately 250 to more than 5000 mineral species. Oxygen also caused
a mass extinction because only few organisms could cope with its highly
reactive nature. The coming 3 billion years life on Earth stayed
relatively similar.</p>
<p>Around 540 MYA Earth was struck by a large ice age, White Earth.
Again leading to a mass extinction due to the cold. However, volcanic
activity came to the rescue by producing greenhouse gasses and an
atmosphere that could retain more heat.</p>
<p>In less than 20 million years (MY) Earth radically changed again and
turned into Green Earth (520 MYA). There was an explosion of life, and
life suddenly evolved from being mainly unicellular to complex
multicellular forms.</p>

<li>Eukaryota are larger and more complex cells, 10-100 <span

internal membrane-bound structures, called organelles, and a
cytoskeleton, which play an important role in defining the cell’s
organization and shape. Eukaryotic DNA is stored in chromosomes. A
chromosome is a long DNA molecule that is stored in a compact form. A
chromosome contains a part or all of the genetic material of an
organism. Human cells have 46 chromosomes, i.e. 23 chromosome pairs.
Each pair consists of one copy from our biological mother and one from
our biological father. The chromosomes are located in the cell nucleus,
which is the organelle maintaining the integrity of chromosomes and thus
of our genes, and plays an important role in the regulation of gene
expression and of the activities of the cell. See Figures

<p>From 3.5 BYA - 540 MYA we find mainly prokaryotic and some simple
eukaryotic organisms in fossils and life was mainly unicellular.</p>
<p>Eukaryotic cells are believed to be generated by endosymbiosis,
i.e. a symbiotic relationship where one organism lives inside the other,
which is beneficial for both organisms.</p>
<p>The process of endosymbiosis that led to eukaryotic cells is
displayed in Figure @ref(fig:endosymbiosis).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">

<p class="caption">
Genesis of eukaryotic cells (Source: wikipedia)
</p>
</div>
<p>First an anaerobic<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> prokaryotic cell was assumed to have grown
and to have developed membrane systems inside the cell, which gave rise
to the formation of the nucleus. At a certain point of time this large
prokaryotic cell with internal membrane systems must have ingested an
aerobic<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a>
proteobacterium, which managed to avoid digestion. The two cells started
with an endosymbiotic relation.</p>
<p>The proteobacterium provided the host cell with additional energy
through the synthesis of ATP by metabolizing carbohydrates and lipids
using oxygen and the host cell fed the proteobacterium with these
bio-molecules. This gave the endosymbiotic pair the ability to grow
further in size and to thrive in the oxygen rich environment of planet
Earth that was established during the Cambrian era that started 540
million years ago. The increase of oxygen is believed to be one of the
major triggers that gave rise to the “biological big bang” that led to
an explosion of novel species and the emergence of all large groups<a
href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a> in the
animal kingdom <span class="citation">(He et al. 2019)</span>.</p>
<p>During their endosymbiotic evolution the proteobacterium gradually
handed over many genes to the cell nucleus, and became under regulation
of the nucleus. It eventually evolved to mitochondria, the organelles
that are the energy plants of a cell. So, we inherit more from mother
than father: we inherit our cell structure as well as our energy system,
i.e. our mitochondria and their remaining DNA, from mother side through
her egg cell.</p>
<p>For plant cells, a second endosymbiotic event must have occurred with
eukaryotic cells and cyanobacteria. The ingested cyanobacteria has
evolved in a similar way into chloroplasts, which give plants the
ability for photosynthesis and led them become the most successful life
form of the globe. Fossil evidence of land plants dates back to 485 MYA
- 420 MYA, however, phylogenetic analysis also suggests an earlier
origin in the Cambrian <span class="citation">(Strother and Foster
2021)</span>.</p>
<p>Other key differences between Prokaryota and Eukaryota are in terms
of their reproduction. For Prokaryota that only takes place by cell
division. A mutation in the DNA is thus fixed in all daughter cells.
While nearly all Eukaryota have a phase of sexual reproduction. They are
diploid organisms, i.e. they have two copies of each gene, one from
fathers’ and mothers’ side. This enables successive mutations to be made
in one copy because another functional copy of the gene is available.
Moreover during sexual reproduction recombination of chromosomes occurs,
i.e. reshuffling of paternal and maternal genes, which leads to much
more variation.</p>
<p>The Eukaryota further evolved in protists, which are unicellular
organisms, fungae, plants and animals.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">3.4</span> Evolution</h2>
<p>How does the evolution of LUCA to all species of the tree of life
occurred? Evolution is largely driven by variability and selection.</p>
<div id="variability-and-selection" class="section level3"
number="3.4.1">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.1</span> Variability and

<p>Variation occurs, among others, through errors in the copying of DNA

of the errors remain.
</p>
</div>
<p></br></p>
<p>The error margin of DNA replication is 1 error per billion base pairs
that are copied, which can lead to point mutations. Note, that we humans
have a genome size of about 6.4 billion base pairs.</p>
<p>Other sources of variability are</p>
<ul>
<li>Insertions or deletions, i.e. base pairs that are added or removed,
respectively.</li>
<li>Recombination, reshuffling of genetic traits, e.g. during sexual
reproduction</li>
</ul>
<p>Most mutations are neutral, i.e. the mutated codon encodes for the
same amino acid. Neutral mutations can be used as a molecular/genetic
clock to tell how far apart two species are in an evolutionary
sense.</p>
<p>But, mutations are not always neutral! For instance, sickle cell
anemia is caused by one point mutation in hemoglobin (see Figure
@ref(fig:sickleCell1) and @ref(fig:sickleCell2)). A T (thymine base) is
mutated to an A (adenine base), which results in a codon that encodes
for the amino acid valine instead of glutamic acid. This causes dramatic
changes to the 3D structure of the hemoglobin protein and causes a
deformation of the red blood cells from a round to sickle shape, which
leads to anemia.</p>
<p>Why does this mutation remain? It mainly occurs in Africa, where the
mutation for sickle cell anemia is selected because it makes affected
individuals resistant against malaria, which gives them a evolutionary
competitive advantage despite their anemia. However, offspring who
inherit the mutation of both parents are not viable. Therefore, the
regular variant of hemoglobin also remains.</p>

</div>
<p>Hence, evolution is a natural process that is driven by two opposing
forces: variation and selection.</p>
<p>Variation occurs by spontaneous copy errors in genetic code or
mutations, among others.</p>
<p>Selection occurs upon ecofactors: Is a mutation beneficial or harmful
for a particular organism in its specific environment? The odds on
fixation of the mutation thus depends on the reproductive success.</p>
<p>The process of genetic variation and selection can eventually lead to
evolution of new species upon many generations.</p>
</div>
<div id="genetic-drift" class="section level3" number="3.4.2">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.2</span> Genetic Drift</h3>
<p>Another important process for the origin of species is genetic drift.
This are random fluctuations of alleles, which are particular sequence
variants of a gene. Genetic drift is particularly strong in small
populations. As opposed to selection it is not adaptive.</p>
<p>New species will thus originate more quickly when a small fraction of
the population gets isolated in a new environment.</p>
</div>
<div id="horizontal-gene-transfer" class="section level3"
number="3.4.3">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.3</span> Horizontal Gene
Transfer</h3>
<p>Horizontal gene transfer, which is non-sexual transfer of genetic
information between two distinct organisms, is also important for the
evolutionary process.</p>
<p>This is very common between Prokaryota, i.e. eubacteria and archaea
bacteria, think on the super bugs in hospitals that acquired resistance
to multiple antibiotics. It also occurs between Eukaryota. Mainly in
protists, which are unicellular organisms with a nucleus. As well as
between Prokaryota on the one hand and Eukaryota on the other hand.</p>
</div>
<div id="endosymbiosis-1" class="section level3" number="3.4.4">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.4</span> Endosymbiosis</h3>
<p>Endosymbiosis is also a very important driver of evolution. Niles
Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould have shown that the fossil record
indicates that evolution happens in bursts: it is slow most of the time
until suddenly rapid changes occur over a brief time <span
class="citation">(Margulis 1999)</span>. According to Lynn Margulis this
can be explained due to endosymbiosis, where one species starts to live
within another species, which is a source of evolutionary novelty that
can give rise to an explosion of novel life forms. We already touched in
more detail upon an important endosymbiosis event in section
@ref(endosymbiosis).</p>
</div>
<div id="teleonomy" class="section level3" number="3.4.5">
<h3><span class="header-section-number">3.4.5</span> Teleonomy</h3>
<p>The term teleonomy means that evolution only has the primitive goal
to maintain and reproduce the species, and, that it thus has no other
purpose and thus also no direction.</p>
<p>When complex organs and organisms originate it might seem as if there
is a direction or purpose, but, that is not the case! A good example is
the development of an eye, see Figure @ref(fig:evolutionEye).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/evolutionEye.png" alt="The evolution of an eye (Source: Wikipedia)" width="45%" />
<p class="caption">
The evolution of an eye (Source: Wikipedia)
</p>
</div>
<p>Indeed,</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The eye is not developed by evolution with the purpose to
see.</p></li>
<li><p>The eye only has the function to see.</p></li>
<li><p>It is the result of a gradual process where each adaptation gave
a reproductive advantage in a particular environment.</p></li>
<li><p>In another environment it can be no longer functional and than it
might disappear or might become dysfunctional, e.g. moles eyes.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Hence, the origin of a species is the result of evolution, but, not
the purpose of evolution. Evolution is thus adaptation with as sole goal
maintenance and reproduction.</p>
<p>From the distribution of the complexity of species in Figure
@ref(fig:distributionComplexity), it is clear that the most abundant
species in number always has been bacteria. Indeed, evolution has no
direction. The distribution of complexity at present, however, has a
tail to the right. This mainly stems from the fact that there is lower
bound of complexity of living organisms. Hence, evolution could not
generate organisms with a complexity below this lower bound and it
therefore only seems as if it slightly favors increasing complexity.</p>

<p>Note, that</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Plants are the most successful group in terms of the mass of
carbon that they fixate.</p></li>
<li><p>Bacteria clearly dominate the more complex animal
kingdom.</p></li>
<li><p>Animals represent a relative small fraction. Among animals,
cattle and humans are over represented.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Other compelling evidence that there is no direction to evolution
stems from the number of bacterial cells in our body. <span
class="citation">Sender, Fuchs, and Milo (2016)</span> showed that the
ratio of the number of bacterial cells to the number of human cells is
close to 1. A human with a weight of 70kg has <span
class="math inline">\(\pm\)</span> 38 trillion bacterial cells and 30
trillion humane cells. Note, that trillion is a thousand billion or
10<span class="math inline">\(^{12}\)</span>!</p>
<p>So, all these examples make clear that evolution has no direction.
For every organism with a higher complexity there also emerge many
organisms with lower complexity! However, we can view evolution as a
creative process that is generating novel life forms that are well
adapted to their environment.</p>

<div id="onthogenesis" class="section level1" number="4">
<h1><span class="header-section-number">4</span> Onthogenesis</h1>
<p>The ontogenesis is the development of an organism from a fertilized
egg cell up to the adult stage until we eventually die.</p>
<p>Our ontogenesis starts from the genetic potential we inherit from our
parents through their egg and sperm cell. The fertilized egg cell then
starts to divide and at a certain point the cells start to differentiate
into different tissues. Each of our cells, apart from our germ cells,
has the same genetic material!</p>
<p>Another very important factor in our development is our environment
and how we interact with our environment. Indeed, our phenotype, our
observable traits and characteristics, stem from the complex interplay
between our genomic makeup, our genotype, and environmental factors.</p>
<p>Key questions that arise in this respect is how cells of different
tissues of the same organism that share the same genetic code can be
morphologically so distinct, and how the environment and changes in our
environment can impact our phenotype?</p>
<p>This is due to epigenetics!</p>
<div id="epigenetics" class="section level2" number="4.1">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Epigenetics</h2>
<p>Epigenetics is the study of how development, behavior and environment
can cause changes that affect the way we use our genes. Unlike genetic
changes, epigenetic changes are reversible and do not change your DNA
sequence, but they can change how our body can (or cannot) read a DNA
sequence, see Figure @ref(fig:epigenetics).</p>
<div class="figure" style="text-align: center">
<img src="figs/Epigenetic_mechanisms.png" alt="Principes of epigenetics. Small molecules, epigenetic markers, interact with the DNA and histones. They can cause a gene to be accessible or inaccessible for RNA transcription (Source: NIH, Wikipedia)" width="100%" />
<p class="caption">

</p>
</div>
<p>Epigenetic markers, however, are copied during cell division to the
two new cells that are formed. This causes a liver cell to remain a
liver cell and a brain cell to remain a brain cell upon cell
division.</p>
<p>Epigenetic markers are small molecules that interact either directly
with the DNA or with histones, which are specific proteins that act as
spools that wind the long DNA molecule in a more compact/condense form.
They can make genes accessible or inaccessible for RNA transcription and
thus eventually for the production of proteins. Two common types are</p>
<ul>
<li>DNA methylation: binding a methyl group directly to DNA<a
href="#fn5" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref5"><sup>5</sup></a>.</li>
<li>Histone acetylation: binding an acetyl group to histone proteins<a
href="#fn6" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref6"><sup>6</sup></a>.</li>
</ul>
<!-- Note, that binding a molecule on a protein after translation is also referred to as post translational modification (PTM). -->
<p>Both types can impact the activity of genes. On the one hand DNA
methylation actively represses the expression of a specific gene, while
DNA demethylation enhances gene expression. On the other hand histone
acetylation makes the structure of a region of DNA more open and thus
more accessible for transcription of the genes in that region, while
de-acetylation has the opposite effect.</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Epigenetics during

<p>Epigenetics plays an important role in embryonic development (see
Figure @ref(fig:epiEmbryo)).</p>
<p>(ref:epiEmbryoLab) Epigenetics in embryo genesis at CpG islands,
regions that can bind with many methyl groups. All CpG islands of a
sperm cell are almost fully methylated. That of an egg cell are
methylated around 50%. Upon fertilization the methylation drops and

increases again (Source: Mariuswalter, Wikipedia)</p>

<p>CpG islands are regions in our DNA that can be heavily methylated.
They are major regulatory units and around 70% of our genes have CpG
islands in their promotor regions<a href="#fn7" class="footnote-ref"
id="fnref7"><sup>7</sup></a>. Methylation of the promotor region is
typically associated with a reduction of gene expression. In Figure
@ref(fig:epiEmbryo) we observe that the CpG islands of a sperm cell are
almost fully methylated, which indicates that many genes are likely to
be silenced. Indeed, a sperm cell has one main function and that is to
swim forward and fertilize the egg cell. The CpG islands of an egg cell
are methylated around 50%. Upon fertilization the methylation drops in
the blastocyst (an early stage of embryonic development, about five days
upon fertilization). This is required for the cells to regain the
property that they can divide and differentiate to all cell-types of the
developing organism. As differentiation of the cells starts and as they
evolve into tissues, methylation increases again so that the cells have
access to less genes and get more specific functions. Note, that the
methylation status is also passed upon cell division, which leads to
invariance of differentiated cells: indeed, a liver cell remains a liver
cell upon division and a brain cell a brain cell, etc.</p>

<div id="epigenetics-and-aging" class="section level2" number="4.3">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">4.3</span> Epigenetics and

<p>Epigenetics are also largely driven by ecofactors. This can be nicely
illustrated with identical twins who have almost the same genome. It
gets more easy to tell them apart over time due to epigenetic changes
that are triggered by the different environments to which they were
exposed and that effectively changed how they are using their genes. A
good example is the difference in skin ageing between twins that had a
different exposure to UV radiation (e.g. Figure @ref(fig:epiUV)).</p>

<p>Aging and longevity are influenced by genetic, epigenetic, and

stages. It has been shown that the genetic component (heritability)
plays only a moderate role in aging and longevity, so epigenetics seems
to be a major contributor <span class="citation">(Adwan-Shekhidem and
Atzmon 2018)</span>. Indeed, many epigenetics markers and in
particularly DNA methylation sites have been shown to be remarkable
predictors of chronological age. Aging has been shown to be associated

<p>Epigenetics is plays also an important rol in learning <span

<p>In the last decade, it has been shown that epigenetics is very
important in development of the brain and for learning.</p>
<p>Animal research has shown that the disruption and inhibition of gene
expression and translation in the brain shortly after a learning event,
has a tremendous impact on long time memories (<span
class="math inline">\(\geq 24\)</span> hours), but not on short term
memories. These manipulation had most impact in the first hours upon the
learning event. Suggesting that the initial memory consolidation happens
within a 6 hour time window.</p>
<p>Learning typically happens in waves. Genes activated shortly after
learning return to baseline within 24 hours, a time point at which a
second wave of gene expression is triggered. In the second wave, genes
are included that encode for epigenetic regulators. So, the first wave
within 6 hours upon learning is known to up regulate transcription
factors important to initiate the second wave of transcription, which is
needed to establish long-lasting memories.</p>
<p>Understanding memory consolidation gets even more complex due to the

has been shown to impair memory. So methylation plays a role in
different stages of the process of memory formation.</p>
<p>It also has been shown that methylation influences memory through
different mechanisms, e.g. </p>
<ul>
<li>Regulation of the activity of enhancers, i.e. short DNA regions that
enhance the transcription of genes</li>
<li>Alternative splicing, i.e. transcribed RNA from a gene region is
spliced by which certain exons, i.e. coding stretches, are removed,
resulting in the production of different gene products from the same
gene. So methylation can change the specific gene products that are
transcribed from a particular gene.</li>
<li>Expression of micro RNAs, short non-coding RNAs, that are
biologically active.</li>
</ul>
<p>A large body of literature support the role of methylation in
learning and it is shown that methylation associated to learning occurs
in the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex and the amygdala of the brain
(Figure @ref(fig:brainRegionsLearning)).</p>

<h3><span class="header-section-number">4.4.2</span> Histone
Modifications and Memory</h3>
<p>Another type of epigenetic regulation is through the modification of
histones, i.e. the proteins that act as spools around which the long DNA
molecule is winded and which can affect the accessibility of a DNA
region upon modification.</p>
<p>Histone modifications with epigenetic markers have been shown to be
mainly important in the initial phase of memory consolidation. They are
rapidly modified after which they return to baseline. These
modifications cause “unwinding or winding the DNA from or around the
histones” making particular genes accessible or inaccessible for
expression.</p>
<p>Histone epigenetic markers seem to regulate the transcriptional
sensitivity towards external stimuli. Histone acetylation that makes the
DNA more accessible, for instance, has been shown to increase learning
induced gene expression and seem to be particularly important for
regulating memory strength.</p>
<p>So recent progress has shown the tremendous importance of epigenetics
for brain development and learning, however, the field of
neuro-epigenetics is still in its infancy and many open questions
remain.</p>
